Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) fields, including axions, can form gravitationally-bound substructure. If the structure is bound by the self-gravity of the ULDM particles, it is called an "Axion Star" (or "Boson Star"); if, on the other hand, it is gravitationally bound to some external object (e.g. a star or planet), it is called a "Gravitational Atom" (GA). This notebook provides a useful summary of the properties of static, isolated axion stars and gravitational atoms, which are derivable from the basic equations of motion (the Schrodinger-Poisson, or Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson, equations). Details can be found in [our paper from 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08212).

This project contains one file:
* *AxionStars-and-GravitationalAtoms.nb*: a Mathematica notebook containing summary properties of axion stars and gravational atoms, including their mass-radius relations and density profiles. For gravitational atoms bound to the Sun or Earth, the notebook also provides a constraint on the maximum mass of the bound state, derived from Solar System Ephemerides data (in particular, from [Pitjev and Pitjeva 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5534) for a solar-bound GA and [Adler 2009](https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4879) for an Earth-bound GA).

**Inputs:** This file is self-contained and requires no external inputs.

**Outputs:** This file can be used to generate many useful figures, e.g. this one
